# IT-Traveler 🌍

**IT-Traveler** is a lightweight web app built with **Vue.js**, designed for people who love to explore the world and track their travel locations on an interactive map.

This project was my first hands-on experience with Vue.js after primarily working with React. I created it as a personal experiment to understand Vue's ecosystem, which I found to be more cohesive and intuitive in many ways.

## ✨ Features

- Add and remove custom location markers on a world map
- Attach and edit photos for each location
- Simple and clean user interface
- Built with Vue.js and the Mapbox API

## 🗺️ Mapbox Integration

To use this app, you’ll need a **Mapbox access token**. Register at [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/) to get one.

> ⚠️ Please note: Mapbox is not entirely free — after a limited number of requests, charges may apply. Be sure to review their pricing policy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js (Composition API)
- **Map Service**: Mapbox GL JS
- **Styling**: Tailwindcss
